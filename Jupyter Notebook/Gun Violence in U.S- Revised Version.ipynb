    "America is one of the few countries where it is constitutionally acceptable to possess guns. Due to the easy access to firearms, the homicidal rate is the highest in the USA, amongst all the developed countries and 28th highest overall. In fact, the gun violence rate in the U.S. is even higher than it is in many low-income countries. While it is expected that rich countries with strong government institutions must face lower gun death rates since lower criminal justice systems and poverty can increase violence, it is shocking to know that the USA is an outlier when compared with other developed countries with similar socioeconomic circumstances.  \n",

This will help spread awareness amongst the people and suitable actions can be taken by officials.  "
