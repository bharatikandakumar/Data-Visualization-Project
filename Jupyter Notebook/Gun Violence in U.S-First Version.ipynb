    "America is one of the few countries where it is constitutionally accepted to possess guns. Due to the easy access of firearms, the homicidal rate is the highest in USA, amongst all the developed countries and 28th highest overall. In fact, the gun violence rate in the U.S. is even higher than its is in many low-income countries. While it is expected that rich countries with strong government institutions must face lower gun death rates since lower criminal justice systems and poverty can increase violence, it is shocking to know that USA is an outlier when compared with other developed countries with similar socioeconomic circumstances.
